## Bayesian machine learning notebooks

This repository is a collection of notebooks about various topics of Bayesian methods for machine learning.

- [Latent variable models - part 1: Gaussian mixture models and the EM algorithm](latent_variable_models_part_1.ipynb).
  Introduction to the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and its application to Gaussian mixture models. Example
  implementation with plain NumPy/SciPy and scikit-learn for comparison.

- Latent variable models - part 2: Approximate inference and variational autoencoders. Work in progress, going to replace 
  [previous work](variational_autoencoder.ipynb) on variational autoencoders.

- [Variational inference in Bayesian neural networks](bayesian_neural_networks.ipynb). Demonstrates how to 
  implement and train a Bayesian neural network using a variational inference approach. Example implementation with Keras. 

- [Bayesian regression with linear basis function models](bayesian_linear_regression.ipynb). Introduction to Bayesian
  linear regression. Implementation from scratch with plain NumPy as well as usage of scikit-learn for comparison.

- [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/krasserm/bayesian-machine-learning/blob/master/gaussian_processes.ipynb)
  [Gaussian processes](gaussian_processes.ipynb). Introduction to Gaussian processes. Example implementations with 
  plain NumPy/SciPy as well as with libraries scikit-learn and GPy. 

- [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/krasserm/bayesian-machine-learning/blob/master/bayesian_optimization.ipynb)
  [Bayesian optimization](bayesian_optimization.ipynb). Introduction to Bayesian optimization. Example implementations 
  with plain NumPy/SciPy as well as with libraries scikit-optimize and GPyOpt. Hyperparameter tuning as application example.  

- [Variational auto-encoder](variational_autoencoder.ipynb). About to be replaced by two newer notebooks on latent variable 
  models, [part 1](latent_variable_models_part_1.ipynb) and part 2 (work in progress). 

- [Deep feature consistent variational auto-encoder](variational_autoencoder_dfc.ipynb). Describes how
  a perceptual loss can improve the quality of images generated by a variational auto-encoder. Example implementation with
  Keras.  

- [Conditional generation via Bayesian optimization in latent space](variational_autoencoder_opt.ipynb). Describes an approach
  for conditionally generating outputs with desired properties by doing Bayesian optimization in latent space of variational 
  auto-encoders. Example application implemented with Keras and GPyOpt.

- [Topic modeling with PyMC3](topic_modeling_pymc3.ipynb). An introduction to topic models and their implementation with the
  probabilistic programming library [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/).
